# SyedEstate

SyedEstate is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of connecting buyers or tenants with sellers of real estate properties. Whether you're looking to rent or buy, SyedEstate offers a clean and easy-to-use interface with comprehensive search options that help you find the perfect property based on your specific requirements. The project is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), ensuring a robust and scalable application with a secure user authentication system.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy for users to browse, search, and filter property listings.
- **Comprehensive Search Options**: Filter properties based on location, price range, property type, number of bedrooms, and more.
- **Secure Authentication**: Secure user login and registration system with encrypted passwords and JWT-based authentication.
- **Property Listings**: View detailed property listings with images, descriptions, pricing, and contact information for sellers.
- **User Profiles**: Manage your profile, view saved properties.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with TailwindCSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, property listings, and other related information.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state.
